/* ZOJ Problem Set - 1652
 * Count the Regions
 * Yidong Zheng, 2013-2-3
 * number theory
 * divide the plane
 * Solve:
 * a zig-zag line consists of 3 lines,
 * say line a, line b, line c(a//b).
 * We call f(n) the number of
 * parts can a plane at most 
 * divided into by n zig-zag lines.
 * A line can add at most n parts to the plane
 * where n is the number of lines on the plane.
 * so a&b[which is parellel] can provide with
 * 3*(n-1)+1 parts.Line c can then provide with 
 * 3*(n-1)+3 parts.But a,b,c can itself provide
 * only two parts(becauce c is just a segment
 * and a,b is half-line,they can provide 6 parts
 * if they are all lines),we need to subtract 4(6-2) from
 * the original ans.
 * we then get f(n)=f(n-1)+3*3(n-1)+2+3-4 = f(n-1)+9n-8;
